- This repo uses 2 pre-trained models to solve the problem of text readability, one is PhoBERT, the other is PhoGPT.
- There are 2 file:
  - phoBERT_0_feature.ipynb: fine-tuning the PhoBERT model to be able to encode text, then fed this output into SVM to classify the text.
  - phogpt-250-73.ipynb: fine-tuning the PhoGPT model to classify the text.
